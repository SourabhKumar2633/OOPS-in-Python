# OOPS-in-Python
- In Python, object-oriented Programming (OOPs) is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes in programming. It aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, polymorphisms, encapsulation, etc. in the programming.
- The main concept of OOPs is to bind the data and the functions that work on that together as a single unit so that no other part of the code can access this data.

### Advantage of python being an Object Oriented Programming Language
- Development and maintenance of Python codes is easier than the procedural programming.
- Python can easily solve the real world problems as it does not works on step by step instructions.
- Data in Python codes are secure due to its special feature of data hiding
